# Py-PL0-Parser
A PL/0 Parser implemented in Python

## Grammar
The grammer is based on wikipedia's [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) page.
```ebnf
program = block "." ;

block = [ "const" ident "=" number {"," ident "=" number} ";"]
        [ "var" ident {"," ident} ";"]
        { "procedure" ident ";" block ";" } statement ;

statement = [ ident ":=" expression | "call" ident 
              | "?" ident | "!" expression 
              | "begin" statement {";" statement } "end" 
              | "if" condition "then" statement 
              | "while" condition "do" statement ];

condition = "odd" expression |
            expression ("="|"#"|"<"|"<="|">"|">=") expression ;

expression = [ "+"|"-"] term { ("+"|"-") term};

term = factor {("*"|"/") factor};

factor = ident | number | "(" expression ")";
```

## Features
- [x] Lexer: converts source code into tokens
- [x] Parser: converts tokens into an AST
- [x] ASTInterpreter: interprets the AST
- [ ] IR Generator: generates an IR from the AST
- [ ] IR Interpreter: interprets the IR

## Test
To test a certain program, either use pytest to run the test file or run the following command:
```bash
python3.11 <path-to-program> < <path-to-input>
```
and the output will be printed to the console.
